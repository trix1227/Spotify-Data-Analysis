```{r Packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Reading the data and take a quick look

```{r message=FALSE}
Spotify <- read_csv("top10s.csv")
```

## I opt to rename the column X1 with numbers

```{r}
Spotify <-Spotify%>%rename(Number = X1)
summary(Spotify)
```

## let's check the genre

I would like to see how the genre is distributed and next I will separate the first and the rest of the genre 
```{r}
table(Spotify$`top genre`)
Spotify <-Spotify%>%separate((`top genre`),c("variable","genre"),extra='merge')
```

Now, lets regroup and simplify the genre

```{r}
other <-c("complextro","downtempo","brostep","electro","electronic","escape","folk-pop","hollywood","house","irish","permanent","neo","metropolis","tropical")
Spotify$genre[Spotify$variable %in% other]  <- 'Other'
Spotify$genre[Spotify$variable =='hip']  <- 'hip hop'
Spotify$genre[Spotify$variable =='latin']  <- 'latin'
Spotify$genre[Spotify$variable =='boy']  <- 'pop'
Spotify$genre[Spotify$variable =='french']  <- 'pop'
Spotify$genre[Spotify$variable =='electropop']  <- 'pop'
Spotify$genre[Spotify$variable =='pop']  <- 'pop'
Spotify$genre[Spotify$genre=='contemporary r&b'] <-'r&b'
Spotify$genre[Spotify$genre=='room'] <-'Other'
table(Spotify$genre)

miss <- colSums(is.na(Spotify))
print(miss[miss>0])

Spotify <-na.omit(Spotify)
```

And now I have the simple genre and I will begin my data exploration 

## Data exploration
I wanna know which song is the most popular song? Which artist has the most popular song from 2010-2019? and which artist has most popular song in 2019
By running the codes I know that, the most popular song in 2019 is "Memories by Maroon 5", Katy Perry has the most popular songs from 2010 - 2019 and Ed Sheeran has the most popular songs in 2019

```{r}
most_popular <- Spotify%>%arrange(desc(pop))
most_popular

plot_most_popular <-most_popular%>%filter(year==2019)%>%ggplot(aes(artist))+geom_bar()+coord_flip()+ggtitle("Artist & #Pop song 2019")
plot_most_popular

most_popular_artist <- most_popular%>%count(artist)%>%arrange(desc(n))
most_popular_artist%>%head(15)%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(artist,n),y=n))+geom_col(fill="skyblue")+ggtitle("15 Most Popular Artist")+coord_flip()

```

## Measure Analysis 

##1. Analyze the duration 
Most of the song has a duration of 3-4 mins
There is an outlier in pop category, we have song with most/min duration 
The longest song (424s) is by Justin Timberlake "TKO" & the shortest song (134s) is by Justin Bieber "Mark My Words"
Both records are by Justins :)

```{r}
duration <-Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(genre,dur),y=dur))+geom_boxplot(fill="skyblue")+ggtitle("Song Duration")+theme_light()
duration

max_pop <-Spotify%>%filter(dur>=400)%>%group_by(artist)%>%summarise(title,dur)
max_pop

min_pop <-Spotify%>%filter(dur<=150)%>%group_by(artist)%>%summarise(title,dur)
min_pop
```


##2. Analyze the bpm
Most songs have bpm around 100-150 bpm, which some few songs from pop genre has bpm >200bpm
Those are : LA love by Fergie, How Ya Doin? by Little Mix and FourFiveSeconds by Rihanna

```{r}
bpm <- Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(genre,bpm),y=bpm))+geom_boxplot(fill="skyblue")+ggtitle("bpm Distribution")+theme_light()
bpm

bpm_most <-Spotify%>%filter(bpm>=200)%>%group_by(artist)%>%summarise(title,bpm)
bpm_most
```

##3. Analyze the energy
Not a big suprise here, the genre pop, latin, dance & rock are the genre with median >= 75
So if we need a pick me up songs perhaps looks from one of this genre to boost our mood, next lets find from which artist? 
Martin Solveig Hello and Jonas Brother Pom Pom are the songs with highest energy, at 98

```{r}
energy <- Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(genre,nrgy),nrgy))+geom_boxplot(fill="skyblue")+ggtitle("Energy Distribution")+theme_light()
energy

most_nrgy_artist <-Spotify%>%arrange(desc(nrgy))%>%select(artist,nrgy,title)
most_nrgy_artist

energy_artist <-most_nrgy_artist%>%head(20)%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(artist,nrgy),y=nrgy))+geom_boxplot()+coord_flip()+theme_light()
energy_artist

```
##4. Analyze the danceability
Edm & Latin are the genre with highest median danceability score. Again, no big suprises. Their median score is close to 75
The top songs with highest danceability score are : Bad Liar by Selena Gomez & Drip by Cardi B 

```{r}
dance <- Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(genre,dnce),dnce))+geom_boxplot(fill="skyblue")+ggtitle("Danceability Distribution")+theme_light()
dance

most_dnce_artist <-Spotify%>%arrange(desc(dnce))%>%select(artist,dnce,title)
most_dnce_artist

dance_artist <-most_dnce_artist%>%head(20)%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(artist,dnce),y=dnce))+geom_boxplot()+coord_flip()+theme_light()
dance_artist

```

##5. Analyze the value
Latin has the highest median for value, but the top songs with highest value score are : Mmm Yeah by Austin Mahone and Theres nothing holding me back by Shawn Mendes

```{r}
val <- Spotify%>%filter(!dB==-60)%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(genre,val),y=val))+geom_boxplot(fill="skyblue")+ggtitle("Positivity Distribution")+theme_light()
val

most_val_artist <-Spotify%>%arrange(desc(val))%>%select(artist,val,title)
most_val_artist

artist <-most_val_artist%>%head(20)%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(artist,val),y=val))+geom_boxplot()+coord_flip()+theme_light()
artist

```
##6. Analyze the speech
Before running the code, I take a guess it should be rap genre with the highest median value
And running the code confirms this hunch, and I noticed there are a lot of outlier for pop genre thus I will pull out the songs 

```{r}
spch <- Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=reorder(genre,spch),y=spch))+geom_boxplot(fill="skyblue")+ggtitle("Speech Distribution")+theme_light()
spch

spch_pop <-Spotify%>%filter(spch>=20)%>%group_by(artist)%>%summarise(title,spch)
spch_pop

```


#Now I would like to test some hypthoesis and see if the variables are indeed correlated 
##1 Energy & danceability by genre, the higher the energy the song must be more dancable
From the graph and the correlation calculation, I can see that the correlation is a bit weak (0.16) 
I guess this make sense as some songs such as rock genre has lot of energy but it is not danceable 


```{r}
nrgy_dnce <-Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=nrgy,y=dnce))+geom_point()+ggtitle("Energy/Danceability")+theme_light()+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
nrgy_dnce

#let's check the correlation
cor(Spotify$nrgy,Spotify$dnce)

```
##2 Positivity & Energy.. the more positive song, will convey more energy
I am quite please to see that the correlation is 0.41 for this hypthoesis and particularly from genre such as dance/hip hop and pop we can see this 
Though for hip hop the line is not that well fit 


```{r}
val_nrgy <-Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=val,y=nrgy))+geom_point()+ggtitle("Positivity/Energy")+theme_light()+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
val_nrgy

#let's check the correlation
cor(Spotify$val,Spotify$nrgy)


#the correlation result is 0.41. let's check if there are any genre in particular
val_nrgy <-Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=val,y=nrgy))+geom_point()+ggtitle("Positivity/Energy")+theme_light()+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)+facet_wrap(~genre)
val_nrgy
```

##3 Energy & Acoustic. The lower the energy the lower the acoustic  
Wow! Look at that, the correlation is at -0.563!


```{r}
acous_nrgy <-Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=acous,y=nrgy))+geom_point()+ggtitle("Acoustic/Energy")+theme_light()+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
acous_nrgy

#let's check the correlation
cor(Spotify$acous,Spotify$nrgy)
```
##4 Last, I would like to check bpm & danceability 
Before running the code and seeing rsult from point 1, I would already expect that there should not be any strong correlation between the two 
And from the correlation we notice that the result is -0.13, but somehow from the plot it is hard to conclude anything


```{r}
acous_nrgy <-Spotify%>%ggplot(aes(x=acous,y=nrgy))+geom_point()+ggtitle("Acoustic/Energy")+theme_light()+geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
acous_nrgy

#let's check the correlation
cor(Spotify$acous,Spotify$nrgy)
```

##Summary : 
#1. Katy Perry is the artist with the most top songs from 2010 - 2019, with 17 songs 
#2. Maroons 5 Memories is the most popular song from 2010-2019 with score of 99 
#3. Ed Sheeran is the artist with most top song from 2019, 5 songs 
#4. The longest song (424s) is by Justin Timberlake "TKO" & the shortest song (134s) is by Justin Bieber "Mark My Words"
#5. Martin Solveig Hello and Jonas Brother Pom Pom are the songs with highest energy, at 98. While for the genre, go for : Dance, Latin & Rock
#6. Mmm Yeah by Austin Mahone and Theres nothing holding me back by Shawn Mendes are the songs with highest value. While for the genre go for : Edm, Rock & Latin 
#7. There are a correlation between value & energy (cor at 0.41), the highest the value so does the energy. And the genre showing this are : Dance, Hip Hop & Pop
#8. The are a correlation betwen energy & accoustic, the lower the energy so does the acoustic (cor at -0.56)
#9. So next time when I need some mood booster I will def goes for any Danc, Hip Hop or Pop genre on Spotify!
